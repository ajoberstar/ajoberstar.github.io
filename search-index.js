command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore. The \"index\" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index. This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run add again to add the new content to the index. The grgit-status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next commit. Please see grgit-commit for alternative ways to add content to a commit. patterns (Set, default []) Files to add content from. A leading directory name (e.g. dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the index to match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g. specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1 modified in the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the working tree, but also a file dir/file3 removed from the working tree. update (boolean, default false) Update the index just where it already has an entry matching patterns. This removes as well as modifies index entries to match the working tree, but adds no new files.

SSH protocol using JSch (a Java implementation of the SSH protocol). This approach can use JSch Agent Proxy as a way to get SSH keys from ssh-agent or Pageant. There have been numerous issues with JSch authentication. It may work for you, but you could run into issues from conflicting JNA libraries, host key authentication issues, algorithm negotiation. Additionally, the JSch Agent Proxy library hasn’t been maintained since 2014 (as of April 2018). SSH protocol using ssh or plink directly. This approach should work as long as you can push/pull on your machine This is intended to replace JSch, but is new as of Grgit 2.2.0. If it proves to be reliable, it will be on by default in 3.0.0. This support must be explicitly enabled with the system property org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.command.allow=true. The following system properties can be set to configure which authentication options are available when performing a transport command. Generally, you shouldn’t need to modify any of these unless you are having an issue and need to bypass or force or particular method. org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.force (one of hardcoded, interactive, sshagent, pageant) org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.hardcoded.allow (true or false, default true) org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.interactive.allow (true or false, default true) org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.sshagent.allow (true or false, default true) org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.pageant.allow (true or false, default true) org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.command.allow (true or false, default false) When credentials/input are needed, they will be selected in the following precedence, if available: Hardcoded (i.e. username/password) credentials, if provided. Interactive credentials provided via a dialog prompt. This is only available in non-headless JVMs, and will only display if the input couldn’t be retrieved in another manner. For SSH URLs using JSch, a key may be used from one of the following sources: SSH key in a default location (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa) SSH key from a user-specified location Keys loaded into a running ssh-agent Keys loaded into a running Pageant For SSH using command mode, any keys your ssh or plink can natively pick up by default will be used. This should include keys in default locations (e.g. ~/) and any compatible SSH agent or OS keychain. If your key is password protected and not loaded in an agent, authentication will fail. Grgit cannot provide credentials to the external commands. These are presented in precedence order (direct parameter in code, system properties, environment variables).

Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one).

This allows you to interact easily with Git repositories from general applications using Groovy or from Gradle builds. As of Grgit 3, the coordinates for the library have changed. Instead of: org.ajoberstar:grgit: Use one of: org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-core: org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-gradle: The Gradle plugin ID has not changed. It is still org.ajoberstar.grgit. To use Grgit as a library, use it as a dependency from Maven Central. Available versions can be found in the release notes. build.gradle repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { compile 'org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-core:' } pom.xml org.ajoberstar.grgit grgit-core ... To use Grgit in a Gradle build, see the documentation for org.ajoberstar.grgit. First you need to get an instance of Grgit, by either initializing a new repo or opening or cloning an existing repo. Once you have a Grgit instance, you can use the available operations to inspect or modify the repo. Each operation has 3 variants, depending on your preference: // no arg variant, only applies to operations that don't require input grgit.log() // map argument variant grgit.log(includes: ['master', 'other-branch'], excludes: ['old-stuff'], skipCommits: 5) // closure argument variant grgit.log { range('1.0.0', '1.5.1') maxCommits = 2 } Look in the grgit-reference documentation for information on each available operation, it’s options, and example usage. Additionally, see the authentication documentation if you plan to interact with a remote repository. In an example like this, using the HTTP protocol, you’ll likely need to specify basic auth credentials. This can be done via system properties or environment variables. SSH access (including ssh-agent and Pageant) are also supported. (Again, see the authentication documentation.)
