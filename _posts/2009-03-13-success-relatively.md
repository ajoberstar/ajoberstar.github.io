So now that the data is sorted by date as the Gravity team describes in their paper everything worked according to plan.  It ran in 13 epochs instead of 50-ish and got a .9217 RMSE instead of 1.0014.

Now I can finally start playing around with the other things they've tried.  Maybe at some point I can try something of my own.
