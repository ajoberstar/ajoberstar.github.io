I went through my NSVD1 code many times, rewriting it completely four or five times, modifying it countless times, but never beating that 1.013. I even redid the math in that paper to make sure there weren't typos, and I don't have time to try and figure that out anymore.

With how far through the semester I am now, I don't have time to try any other algorithms, which is very disappointing but I'll live. So the remainder of my time is going to spent on optimizing the BRISMF code that I already have and try and squeeze as much out of that as possible before I write my paper.
